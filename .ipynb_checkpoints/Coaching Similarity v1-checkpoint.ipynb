      "Coach:  [00:00:00] so how are you feeling the first time [00:00:02]? \n",
      "Coach:  [00:00:10] good, good.  So, I'm glad that you're feeling great or good about it.  Hopefully, we can get you to feel even better for the next time.  So first of all, I just want to say I appreciate that you maintain enthusiasm in the simulator.  I know that's hard when you're like trying to interact with these avatars such students.  Also, I want to say that I really appreciated the way that you were constantly probing for evidence.  When a student would make a claim, you would say, \"What makes you think that?  What in the text?\" [00:00:35]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:00:36] And then you were also facilitating and pointing them to places in the text.  So I think that as we move forward and we try to make the next simulation a little stronger, it might be best for us to focus on scaffolding for student comprehension. [00:00:50]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:00:51] So sometimes students um can struggle to comprehend the text that they're reading.  They can make claims that we know that aren't supported in the text, can be outright refuted.  So we really want to focus on the feedback that we provide them to help support them in making sense and also revising their response.  So can you think of a time during the last simulation where a student gave an answer that was not accurate [00:01:16]? \n",
      "Coach:  [00:01:38] good.  So I'm glad that you're putting out--those out.  Let's focus on one Eva for the second question.  So she said that Lisa is the new student intern.  Why is that not a valid claim [00:01:50]? \n",
      "Coach:  [00:01:54] exactly.  So think about what you're already doing well.  What could you do to like stick with Eva to help her realize that that's a misconception?  Because that's not really what's happening right in the question like who is she really?  So what might you be able to do?

      "Coach:  [00:02:23] perfect.  Perfect [00:02:23].\n",
      "Coach:  [00:02:30] Right?  So we know that with Ava’s responses in regard to the question number two, and with who Lisa really is.  So what I going to reference or to this place in the text talks about if Pismo was so smart, would he be able to tell who she really was, would he know that her cover as a student intern was all a lie?  So maybe one of the best things to do would be to reference Eva, and other students to revisit this piece of the text and then ask Eva, \"Eva, after looking at this passage, would you want to revise your answer?\" [00:03:05] \n",
      "Coach:  [00:03:06] And hopefully she would.  And at that point you just want to make sure you're continuing to get high quality descriptive feedback like, \"Eva, I really like how you went back in the text, you know, after spending more time with it, you did something that really good readers do.  You make revisions to readers,\" those sorts of things.  And just keep that in mind that you - that would also be a good strategy moving forward for Ethan as well. [00:03:30] \n",
      "Coach:  [00:03:32] So how might the feedback that we just talked about pointing them back to the text, having them kind of grapple at everything.  How might that be better than kind of leaving it open to like moving on to other students and seeing if they have a response [00:03:47]?\n",
      "Coach:  [00:03:48] Right.  Yeah, you've [00:03:49] -\n",
      "Coach:  [00:03:52] right.  Is there like [00:03:53] -\n",
      "Coach:  [00:03:57] so if you don't address it in the moment, you're kind of really just hoping, right then that the conversation gets back to that and that the students - the other students kind of point you in that direction and that Eva will, you know, hopefully realize that that was a misconception .  But if you address it hadn't went, then you'll have dealt with it.  Because you don't want - well, what you don’t want to happen is for students to leave thinking that, \"Oh, it could've been - she could have been a student intern or she could've been a spy she could have been a reporter.\"  Okay.  So let's do a brief practice.  So, let's see.  So I'll ask - so I'm going to ask you a question and then you can respond.  So, how about if I said that Lisa is feeling angry when - when the lie detector results I brought up, what would you say to me [00:04:58]? \n",
      "Coach:  [00:05:07] you could ask why they think that [00:05:09].\n",

      "Coach:  [00:00:20] Oh my gosh. Perfect so, okay.  Yeah, I know, I think there was a lot that you did really well.  So, like for example, you said things like, Ethan, please put away the technology.  And did you notice that he put it away, right away.  And you were like, Ethan, please remember to have a quiet voice.  So, you were like, really direct with him and you were super calm.  And then like when you were able to redirect then you would like facilitate the discussion.  That’s awesome. [00:00:45]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:00:47] I feel like there were a lot of really great things.  The only thing I would say is just being like a tiny-like tweaking your language a little bit.  Like when you say like, quiet down, I don’t know if you noticed this but he said like, oh, then I’ll like whistle more quietly or something like that.  So, instead of quiet I would say like, our voices are off or you could even just use a non-verbal if you want. [00:01:09]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:01:11] Yeah.  Because I think like all of your redirections were really short, they were like very direct and then I would just like anytime, there’s language that’s ambiguous, he could interpret it, however he wants.  So, just being really like whatever you want him to do or to stop doing, making sure that there’s no –  that it’s like crystal clear.  But yeah, I feel like that was great. [00:01:32]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:01:34] For sure.  So, I’m going to be a misbehaving student and I’m going to let you practice on me with that specific thing in mind before you go back in the simulation. You ready? [00:01:44]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:01:45] [beatboxing] [00:01:47]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:01:52] Awesome, that was perfect. [00:01:53]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:01:54] So, like when you said turn your voice off, I was still going to keep going, but I love how you were like – yeah, and put your hands on your lap.  So, you’re like, you’ve thought about like what my mouth was doing, what my hands were doing. If they’re like turning away from you, you could even be like ‘eyes on me’.  So, just making it clear about each behavior.  But, yeah, I think that was awesome.  Why is that better than saying something more generic with them?  Like ‘let’s be respectful’ or ‘let’s pay attention’. [00:02:18]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:02:21] Yeah.  Because it’s like the first day, right.  So, like respect, might look different to different people or paying attention in last year’s class might have, you know, it might have been okay to be moving around or making noise or whatever.  Do you have anything else you want to troubleshoot? [00:02:38]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:02:56] No, no, that’s a good point.  Yeah, maybe like pull out the most important piece or you ask them like which one do you think of those -that list you gave me, is the most important one.  I’m trying to remember when they were off-task-  I mean, when they were giving off tasks suggestions, uhm like when Dave is talking about Rocket Club, oh you, were like we can discuss that after class.  I would say something even more specific than that, because I feel like in that case, he was like, well like did you notice that he was like, oh well why after class, or I forget what he said but that would be like, ‘Dev our voices are off unless we’re on topic’. Something super explicit with that too.  But is that what you’re talking about like when they’re giving lots of suggestions for the norm?  I ‘don’t know, I would just say like or you could like pose it to the other kids like okay, Savannah gave us two, should we pick one, should we pick both?’ Something like that. [00:03:52]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:03:54] Yeah, yeah. [00:03:54]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:04:06] Yeah, that’s a good question.  If there’s any misbehavior happening, I would just address that first.  And then, if they are still not really responding, I would just call on them directly.  Uhm in this case, because they’re not like, real students, like I wouldn’t worry about [indiscernible] time. [00:04:27]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:04:33] Yeah.  Because like I think like, if they’re not participating, it could be because the misbehave is distracting them.  You know what I mean? [00:04:39]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:04:40] So, don’t wait for it but stop it.  And then, start the conversation again.  And if you need to like transition quickly like you’re like ‘voices are off, hands are together’ and then you could be like ‘Savannah, what’s a norm’, you know, so that you can just immediately jump back in. [00:04:55]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:04:56] Yeah, I think that’s a good point. [00:04:57]\n",

So first of all, I just want to say I appreciate that you maintain enthusiasm in the simulator.  I know that's hard when you're like trying to interact with these avatars such students.  Also, I want to say that I really appreciated the way that you were constantly probing for evidence.  When a student would make a claim, you would say, \"What makes you think that?  What in the text?\" [00:00:35]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:00:36] And then you were also facilitating and pointing them to places in the text.  So I think that as we move forward and we try to make the next simulation a little stronger, it might be best for us to focus on scaffolding for student comprehension. [00:00:50]\n",
      "Coach:  [00:00:51] So sometimes students um can struggle to comprehend the text that they're reading.  They can make claims that we know that aren't supported in the text, can be outright refuted.  So we really want to focus on the feedback that we provide them to help support them in making sense and also revising their response.  So can you think of a time during the last simulation where a student gave an answer that was not accurate [00:01:16]? \n",
      "Coach:  [00:01:38] good.  So I'm glad that you're putting out--those out.  Let's focus on one Eva for the second question.  So she said that Lisa is the new student intern.  Why is that not a valid claim [00:01:50]? \n",
      "Coach:  [00:01:54] exactly.  So think about what you're already doing well.  What could you do to like stick with Eva to help her realize that that's a misconception?  Because that's not really what's happening right in the question like who is she really?  So what might you be able to do?  What make - what kind of feedback might you be able to give that would help us know that that is a misconception [00:02:18]?\n",
