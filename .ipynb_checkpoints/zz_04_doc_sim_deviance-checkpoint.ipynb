       "'  So how do you feel? how did you get -   It went okay?   Okay and so, hopefully  five minutes to talk about some skills, some things that you can do to make you feel like-- You know, \"it\\'s the best five minutes ever.\"   Um, so I think you did a really nice job, one thing that I was really happy to see is that you provided really specific feedback and I mean, you know, I kept hearing you say, you know, we\\'re still being silent um,  no drumming, so it\\'s very specific in behaviors . And so it\\'s really important that interactions are specifics so the students know exactly what you want them to do.   Um, so one thing I think that we can do in the next simulation um, is try to work to make your re-directions a little more succinct,um, because sometimes they just took a little but-   -longer-   -Than what I think they could. So let\\'s say um- let think about Avatar talking about Classic Man.   Yeah. So um,  what do you think is uh, one way that you could like make the uh, re-directions succinct?   Oh, okay .   Oh.   Okay.   Yeah. So I- yeah I think like being very like succinct and then being like let\\'s relate this to classroom-   -more, so like very clearly, like naming the action and then where you  h-happen.   And so lets\\'s think of another example, uh, so the first time like you- we started and Avatar\\'s making those voices-   -or something like that. Uh, so what is a way that you could respond that is specific and succinct to um, Avatar making noise?   Yeah, I think you can do that, you seem very hesitant with that, like-   No, I think that, you know, they\\'re tons of different ways you can do succinct. You know you can do, \"Avatar please be quiet,\" you know, succinct doesn\\'t   -you know and that\\'s one way that\\'s just- you can get right back to it, things like that.   So, why do you think it\\'s like a good idea to use these like succinct-   Yeah, yeah and I think because it like- it can also can just like change the whole attitude of the classroom too, and you\\'re just like spending so long talking about these things that you don\\'t- and I think you even said at the end about classrooms, I haven\\'t heard from Savannah and Avatar yet just because it takes so much time.   So I think providing those specific succinct-   -   Okay. Do we-- how long do we have?   Great, so let\\'s do, would you do a bit of role playing? I will be an off task student um, and you can practice different ways to um, make me .   Yes.   I should have a little fun  all right. So-   Yeah.   So it\\'s addressing it right away, it\\'s being very specific-   - um, and succinct  right back into  you know, so they can  expectations.   So, just saying it over a really nice, calm voice-   -which he didn\\'t seem to get very riled   in the last one. So, just take that approach and-   -you know, \"Please, be quiet,\"and more .   Okay. Do you have any questions or-   Okay.   Right. You wanna try another way? Or you- Okay, all right. Um, good, so we\\'re going to focus on specific, succinct, \"be quiet\", voices off, \"listen silently-\"   -those things.   Okay?   All right.'"
