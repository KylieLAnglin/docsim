For each coaching transcript from Fall 2017 (here), I'd you to classify the coach as focusing on one of four skills:

1) Probes for textual evidence
2) Scaffolding student understanding
3) Descriptive feedback
4) Probing for warrant

In the end, I'd just like a CSV file with two columns: candidate ID and skill (coded as 1,2,3, or 4). 

Then, I want something similar for Spring 2018 coaching transcripts (here). We'll want to again classify the coach as focusing one of four skills:
1) Timely responses to misbehavior
2) Specific responses to misbehavior
3) Succinct responses to misbehavior
4) Calm responses to misbehavior
