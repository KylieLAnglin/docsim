       "'   I have to set a little timer for us here.  Okay, we’re going to work on some strategies for the simulation for the next five minutes.  This is Mike   coaching session for William Sweet.  So, let’s start.  What did you think?  How do you feel about it?      Right.  What was challenging about it?     Yeah, that’s tough. .    So, well, what you did a good job of was that you are able to like you identified the behaviors quickly and you were talking to the students about what they should have been doing, right?  So as soon as their misbehavior began you would address it you would talk to Dev or Ethan, and you moved to redirect them, which is the important first step.  But this time what I want us to focus on is making your redirections a little bit more specific, right?  So, let me give you an example of what I mean by that.  So, for example, when you were talking to Ethan about beatboxing, right?  And this is just for that simulation, so Ethan, that’s not very respectful, we want to set rules so everyone can get along.  Ethan, could you please quiet down for me?  And then Ethan responded”I could”, right?  So, what do you think that indicates that Ethan response there?  Any ideas?     Right, right, exactly.  And the other idea is this idea of like, respect, right?  Like this is your first day in the classroom, right?  So, you’re setting up these norms, you have an idea of what it means to be respectful but these students might not have that idea, right?  That’s part of this established thing.  So when I say specific, you’re definitely on the right track there with like the directive, it’s you need to give the students directives that it’s very clear what it means to comply with that directive, right?  So, even editing that, like, could you please quiet down for me?  You might say, Ethan, voice off, hands in front of you and turn back and continue.  Right?  And of course, you can still say thank you Ethan I appreciate it, right?  Like moving on from there and to bring that up, do you remember the time from the simulation when Ethan did comply?     Because you had a solid one. When you asked Ethan to put his phone away, right?  It was super clear, you said, well, there’s a little bit of push back-     And he said,   But then you said will you please put your phone away.  So the next time the student is, let’s say, humming in the background, I’ll do this.  I’m going to act like I’m a student and then practice directing me what you might say.     Please stop.  Yeah, please stop humming and make sure you include that like, what they should be doing, right?  You need to ask them to do such a thing that like you can see that they’re complying with you, right?  So, what do you think of like that tip from me?  Like why might that specific redirection be better than getting into this conversation with a student about what respect might look like?     Absolutely.  And it’s about it.  And I also think it’s about like a confidence thing, right?  Like you’re\\xa0the teacher walking into this room, you know, you need to have this two to three, norm generative conversation and it’s okay to say like, Ethan, stop humming.  Thank you.  Like, we have things that need to get done today.  Okay, absolutely.  Okay.  I’m excited to see you give it a shot.  Do you have any questions for me before we try it again?     All right.  Great work. '"

       "'   But I’d love to hear from you how felt the simulation went.     Let’s put aside the peer interaction right now, and focus on what you mentioned before about responding to their answers and specifically what I want you to focus on--first thing I want to say actually is that you did really well and you especially did well making sure that they were having to answer with text evidence in mind and that you give praise when a student did use some evidence. So that’s awesome. That’s like the first thing that we want to make sure that we can do in responding to student answers.  So, keep doing that.     And what I want you to work on is actually using that ability where you’re already pushing students to get text evident to help make sure that students who maybe don’t have a very strong answers, give stronger answers.      Specifically in this case there were two instances where the student answers were not really correct, and so at the end they kind of walked away those student might not know that their answer are not correct.  And I want to make sure that you can correct those answers.     So, how can you do that, if the student has an incorrect answer? .    Oh okay.  So that’s—well let’s back track and talk about the answers.      Okay. So, are there any that struck you as potentially not right answers?     Yeah.  And I know what you mean, like they’re kind of opinion questions.      There is not necessarily one right answer.  But there can be many right answers and still some wrong answers.  So, the excitement answer is incorrect because she is just in the context of that question, when he’s talking about the lie detector results.  He has just brought up the lie detector and we as the audience know that she lied, that those results are false.  So, we can infer that she must be nervous that he got it wrong—that he’ll find out rather, sorry.  And there is no reason that we can give that she would be excited in that moment when he is asking her about the lie detector results.  Does that make sense?     Okay.  So, that’s that one. And then the other one that I saw misunderstanding was um when this student says Lisa is the student intern. That she has been  .    Yeah.  And that one is wrong because she is not, she is pretending right.     So, that student may know that or may not know that, so you have to make sure that they are able to say, oh, she is not really the intern because XYZ.  So, let’s practice with one of those so I will pretend to be the student and I want you to attempt to respond so that I can—well why would you need to respond if I give an incorrect answer?     Yeah, exactly.  Okay, so let’s do that second one. Um, I think that Lisa is the new student intern.  It says in the text right here.     Well, it’s in like the very first sentence I think or the first paragraph, at least.      Um her lie detector results--it says that they were 100 % they were all--that she said everything correctly.     Oh.     I don’t know.     Yeah, that’s great –     Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean you   and you had a bunch of follow up questions that when I got stuck or didn’t quite know, you could help me find it, but without actually giving me the answer, which is awesome. The other piece that evidence that I want to just point you to so you have it in your back pocket is, um, “if Pismo was so smart would he be able to tell who she really was? Which directly shows at the beginning that she is not actually the student intern.     Great. How are you feeling about it?     Okay, no questions about what it is that I’m asking you to do differently?     Okay, and so then remind me why what we just practiced would be a better response then just saying oh – yeah, good answer, and moving onto the next student.     Excellent, all right.  You got this. .'"
