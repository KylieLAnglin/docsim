example1 = "So, we want to move that specific telling them what you want them to stop to right when you notice it and call their name. So, specifically when – I think it was Ethan got his phone out, and you told him to put it away, and he put it away. And then you were able to establish two rules at that time.  But before, you hadn’t gotten any rules really, right?  So, being specific to the actual student of what you want them to stop is really helpful."

script1 = "To make your next simulation even stronger, I want you to focus on making your redirections more specific so that students know exactly what you want them to stop doing or start doing. This helps us make sure that students aren’t confused. For example, I noticed in your last simulation that you told Ethan to pay attention. The words pay attention can be confusing because it can mean different things for different people and you can’t see if a student is following those directions. Next time Ethan has a side conversation I want you to tell them exactly what you want to see. For example, you could say: Ethan, voice off, hands together."
